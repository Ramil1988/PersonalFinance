# Personal Finances
Keep all data about your finance in one App

This app is intended for those, who love to keep all information about personal finances in one place. It is very simple and friendly using App, which contains as much as little screens, as it is supposed to be very convenient for users. Everything is simple in this App: you have the Main screen, where you can see your total Incomes, Expenses, Total Balance (which is difference between your incomes and expenses), your biggest incomes, expenses and respectively the date, when that was occurred. You just need to indicate your incomes, expenses in the coincident screens. The App will remember it, calculate for your convenience and demonstrate it in the screens.

# Displaying data on the Chart

 In expenses section you need first to assign the category of expense and then to fill it up in the next screen, which is about this particular category. On the main screen of expenses you can see the total amount of expenses. In the divided categories, there is a total amount of expenses related to this particular category. Once you have filled in several data of your expenses, you can then see a line chart of this particular category of expense.

In the project I used several frameworks: RealmSwift for storing data on your Phone, Charts for displaying the line chart and the frameworks for setting up the constraints of the views. I prefer to use the Interface building for positioning the views on the screens, but recognize that it may be a tricky way. The App is already available on the App Store https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/personal-finance/id1585724744
